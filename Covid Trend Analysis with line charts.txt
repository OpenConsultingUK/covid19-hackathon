Calculate Start of Impact of Covid in a country with 1 case per 1000 population
Plot the line chart (new cases per 1000 population rolling average 7 days) for:
Most Affected Countries excluding USA,
Least Affected Countries
USA+some other more affected countries not following overall trend.
Observe that in most countries Covid is getting to manageable levels in 90-100 days from impact date. Some countries are different like USA, India, Iran but overall they should follow the same pattern only taking a bit longer than other countries.
Note: #rolling average of new cases smoothens the graphs presented.
