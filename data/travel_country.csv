Internal restrictions:
 Parliament approved another extension of the ‘state of alarm’ until 7 June. This gives the government emergency powers to impose limitations on movement and impose other extraordinary measures. Countrywide restrictions on movement remain in force and residents have been asked to remain at home except to go to work, to buy food, medicines and other essentials, or in the event of emergencies. However infants under the age of 14 allowed out for one hour. The wearing of facemasks on public transport was made compulsory from 4 May. Hotels and short-stay accommodation (such as short-stay campsites or caravan parks) are closed. The measures do not apply to long-term accommodation, such as long-stay campsites, as long as travellers can cater for themselves and do not rely on communal facilities, which will be closed. 

Relaxation of restrictions: 
The gradual relaxation of restrictions began from 4 May, starting with lifting minor restrictions on internal movement. The government is planning to start gradually easing the restrictions as follows. Each autonomous regional government will be able to modify restrictions depending on local realities and all dates remain approximate depending on the evolution of sanitary context. From 4 May, phase 0: appointment based services were allowed to reopen such as hairdressers, dentists, beauty parlours. In the Canary and Balearic islands, phase 1 will start on 4 May unlike the rest of the country (mainland) - see below. From 11 May, phase 1: bars, terraces and restaurants will be able to reopen only to a third of their capacity in selected areas. Bookstores and museums will be allowed to operate to 40% of their capacity. Family members will be allowed to attend funerals. Small gatherings will be allowed for ‘healthy individuals, with no vulnerabilities and no underlying conditions’. Hotels may reopen past this time, with a limited guest number of a third of their capacity and without the use of common spaces. Religious places may also reopen under the same restrictions. Territories authorised to proceed in phase 1 are listed on the Ministry of Health website. From 25 May, phase 2, theatres, cinemas and other cultural locations will be open to a third of their capacity. Weddings may include family members and friends past this phase but no further details are available as of yet. From 8 June, phase 3, food and beverage commerce may open to 50% of their capacity and travel within one’s region of accommodation. Some restrictions have already been lifted for some non-essential workers who are not able to work from home (e.g. the construction sector), while some factories have also been permitted to resume operations.
The authorities continue to recommend that citizens respect social distancing measures and wear face masks. Further details will be made available closer to those dates. Inter-regional travel may be relaxed from 22 June. Universities will remain closed until September. Schools will reopen gradually, with some exceptions to accommodate small children of essential workers.

The red level applies to regions where COVID-19 cases have been confirmed within the last 14 days. Andijan, Bukhara, Fergana, Karakalpakstan, Namangan, Samarkand, Sirdarya and Tashkent (excluding Tashkent city) regions have been designated as red zones. In these regions, existing quarantine measures remain in place, including internal movement restrictions mandating that all residents stay home, except for essential purposes or for work. Only essential and approved businesses are allowed to operate, including pharmacies, grocery shops, banks, dry cleaners and notaries. People are allowed to walk near their homes, provided they maintain social distancing and wear masks. Driving is allowed from 18 May with a permit sticker from 07.00 to 10.00 (local time) and from 17.00 to 20.00 for essential shopping or work. Intercity and inter-regional vehicular movement remains restricted, except for government employees and for those with permits. As of 15 May, sectors including handicraft, maintenance of agricultural machinery and electronic appliance, rent and lease, and accounting, auditing as well as tax consulting have been allowed to operate.
The yellow level applies to regions where COVID-19 cases have not been confirmed within the last 14 days, but where COVID-19 patients are undergoing treatment. This category includes Tashkent, as well as Khorezm and Surkhandarya regions. The same movement restrictions under the red quarantine level apply. However, more businesses are allowed to reopen, including non-food stores, florists, jewellers, hotels, and hair and beauty salons. Taxis are permitted, along with bicycles and scooters. Starting from 15 May, businesses including real estate, advertising and marketing, private employment agencies have been able to resume. In the meantime, people have been allowed to visit parks from 09.00 to 20.00 in strict compliance with social distancing guidelines. People will be allowed to drive between 06.00 to 22.00 from 18 may.

From 15 May, open-air stadiums and museums are allowed to reopen with a limited number of visitors. In addition to the activities allowed under the red and yellow quarantine levels, permits are not required to drive cars from 18 May.
The country’s national carrier, Uzbekistan Airways, will restart a limited number of domestic passenger flights from 18 May. Travellers will need to present a health certificate showing they have tested negative for COVID-19 before being allowed to board. In addition, passengers will be required to pass the coronavirus infection test at the Center for Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance no more than 120 hours before departure.
People who need to go outside for urgent matters are required to wear masks in public places, while gatherings of more than three people, with the exception of groups involving members of the same family, are banned.

Government plans to lift COVID-19 restrictions by July (Fox News, 08.05.2020).   
A three-step plan has been announced to gradually ease restrictions. In the first stage, schools restaurants and cafes will be allowed to re-open; as well as libraries, playgrounds and community centers. Gatherings will be limited to ten people.

Residents with travel history in Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk-do in South Korea, Iran, as well as Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy and Veneto regions in Italy in the past 14 days will be required upon entry to stay in a quarantine centre for 14 days. Residents with travel history in any other overseas locations in the preceding 14 days will be subject to a 14-day mandatory quarantine.

Internal restrictions:
Mainland China: Railway stations and airports have gradually resumed operations and most provinces have resumed their inter-provincial road passenger transportation. Restrictions on public transportation and private car movement have been lifted in most cities.
Hubei province: Restrictions on outbound travel from Hubei province were lifted on 25 March, and restrictions in Wuhan have been lifted on 8 April. Railway and passenger flights have started to resume accordingly with the lifting of restrictions (Wuhan Tianhe International Airport resumed domestic flights on 8 April); however, international flights and flights to/from Beijing will remain suspended until further notice. Those who want to leave Hubei should confirm with their destination city on the local requirements. Various cities and provinces require all travellers from Wuhan to take nucleic acid tests (including Shenzhen, Zhejiang, etc). Shanghai encourages employers to let returning staff from certain areas take nucleic acid tests.
Beijing: On 29 April, the Beijing government announced a new policy that business travellers and returnees who come from domestic ‘COVID-19 low risk’ areas to Beijing will NOT need the 14 days of home quarantine. People who have travelled from low risk areas to Beijing and are currently under home quarantine can halt their home quarantine and medical observation if applicable. The new Beijing policy does not apply to travellers from overseas, Hubei province or other domestic ‘medium and high risk areas’. Personnel returning from Hubei need to register information online in advance and get a negative nucleic acid test certificate before purchasing the returning ticket. After arrival, they need to show the test certificate to enter the community, follow the 14-day quarantine requirement, and take another test before lifting the quarantine. Domestic travellers planning to stay at hotels must present a ‘green’ health code. Chaoyang District has been rated as ‘high’ risk due to recent cluster cases. Travellers from 'high' risk areas are possible to face quarantine and other requirements when entering other provinces and cities. As such requirements vary across the country, travellers need to confirm with the local residence committee or hotel in advance.
As the situation continues to improve across the country, almost all the cities and provinces have declared the local risk level to be low. The latest city is Suifenhe, the border city with Russia in Heilongjiang province, who adjusted its risk level to low from May 6. However, some cities also chose to strengthen their quarantine measures due to re-emergence of local or imported cases. On 10 May, Shulan (Jilin province) raised its risk level to ‘high’ due to new local cases, and has re-strengthened restrictions on local movement and public gathering. Several train routes to/from Shulan have also been suspended.All villages and residential compounds in the city were closed off, and only one person from each household allowed out for two hours every second day for essentials. (The Guardian, 19.05.2020) 

Another example is Taiyuan (who did so on 3 May), Shanxi provincial capital, although it didn’t announce any change to its risk or response level. In Shanghai and Guangdong, public health emergency response levels have been changed from level II to level III.
A new directive has been issued providing more detailed guidance on community quarantine management, including a new clause that says for low-risk areas and communities with no cases detected, inbound travellers from non-high-risk areas are exempted from mandatory quarantine as long as they hold a ‘green’ health code and arrive directly (without a stopover in a high-risk area). As the risk levels still vary across the country, travellers are advised to confirm with the local residence committee or hotel about quarantine requirements in advance.
As each province has different variations of the application, travellers will need to check the relevant application for their destination and register their information online to get the ‘health code’ before the trip. Heilongjiang announced an ‘in-city code’ in addition to the three-colour health code. Personnel with ‘in-city code’ are restricted to travel out of their current city but can move freely inside.
Although such restrictions are easing, many provinces and cities still have in place community 'close-off' style management which means:
A reduction of exit/entry access to the community.
Access control of visitors and visiting vehicles: ID check/registration, temperature measurement at gate, delivery service is to be picked up at the gate of community etc.
If there are confirmed cases in a certain community, there might be a closure of certain units/areas for quarantine depending on the severity of the local outbreak. In Heilongjiang province, re-emergence of local cases has led to strengthening of such measures.
On 13 May, Jilin city was announced to be ‘sealed’. Transportations services such as intercity buses and trains for Jilin city are suspended now. People who want to move out of the city need the nucleic acid test within 48 hours of travel and register the information according to official instructions.",20200601,"All passengers arriving at PEK will have a PCR test and be quarantined at the designated location in Beijing for 14 days.

Internal restrictions:  
A nationwide state of emergency (SoE) has been extended to 31 May. Meanwhile, the government on 14 May lifted the SoE in 39 out of 47 prefectures.
The SoE remains in place in the following prefectures: the capital Tokyo,
Chiba (all Kanto region), Hokkaido (Hokkaido region), Hyogo (all Kansai region), Kanagawa, Kyoto, Osaka and Saitama. Earlier, these prefectures were declared ‘special alert’ areas, where measures to contain the pandemic are focused. The measures include school closures and strongly promoting working from home or staggering commuting hours.
Under SoE, respective governors are allowed to order the closures of facilities such as schools, cinemas, departments stores as well as ban the gathering of large crowds. Essential services, such as medical facilities, pharmacies, supermarkets, convenience stores, factories, public bathhouses and restaurants, will continue to operate.
Prior to the announcement of the state of emergency, the authorities had already requested all people to avoid large gatherings and for those already in areas with an uptick in COVID-19 cases to stay inside their homes. While no nationwide directive to cancel events has been issued, event sponsors have been asked to consider whether events are necessary. It is expected that various public events and access to places such as entertainment places, national museums and sports stadiums will be suspended until further notice. 
From May 28, East Japan Railway Company (JR East) will reduce the number of regular services on the Tohoku, Joetsu and Hokuriku Shinkansen lines, as well as some standard trains, by as much as 50 percent. (The Mainichi, 20.05.2020)  

Relaxation of restrictions: 
On May 25, Prime Minister Abe lifted the state of emergency for Hokkaido, Chiba, Saitama, Tokyo, and Kanagawa. The state of emergency has now been lifted for all of Japan.  However, authorities in many prefectures and municipal wards continue to request restricted hours and/or closures of public venues. Local governments have also established roadmaps for reopening schools, businesses and public venues and events, as well as metrics for reinstituting stay-at-home orders should significant second-wave infections occur.
